This is my blog where I write about things in technology that interest me. I am very interested in lower level
topics and Web Programming.

In terms of Web languages, I have experience in Python, PHP, JavaScript and Dart (Dart was used for app development
but can be used on the web) and I have experience in C and Java outside of that.
